# Project Title
![alt text](image.png)
In this project I wanted to gain experiance in a multi-language porject, mixing a python front-end with a cpp calulation core. For this project I chose Active Contour segmenation also known as Snakes, This lends the espeialy well as we need to load images and initialise a contour whitch is easaly done in python and a interative optimalisation that can be done efficently in cpp.
